# Using the Node ‘redis’ Library To Connect to Vercel KV

This is a code example to support an article posted on [Dev.To](https://dev.to) titled, ["Using the Node Redis Library to Connect to Vercel KV"](https://dev.to/michaelcharles/using-the-node-redis-library-to-connect-to-vercel-kv-38j).

In order for this to work, you'll need to follow the instructions in the article for setting up Vercel KV, and then providing the Redis connection string to the application via an `.env.local` file.
